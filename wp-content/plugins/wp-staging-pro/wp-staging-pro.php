/**
 * Welcome to WPSTAGING.
 *
 * If you're reading this, you are a curious person that likes
 * to understand how things works, and that's awesome!
 *
 * The philosophy of this file is to work on all PHP versions.
 *
 * Before PHP can understand conditionals such as "if, else",
 * it has to parse this file and split it into "tokens". This
 * process is called "lexical analysis", and exists in almost
 * all programming languages.
 *
 * This file uses only syntax that works with all PHP versions,
 * so that any PHP version can parse it and run our version check
 * conditional.
 *
 * Then we include other PHP files to be parsed, this time, certain
 * to be executing in a PHP version that is capable of parsing the
 * the syntax we are using.
